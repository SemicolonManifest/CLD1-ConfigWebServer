# Isolating homes
To prevent other users to acces to other users homes:
```
sudo chmod o-rwx /home/*
```

This command has to be ran after every creation of users without the script.


## Secure SSH for users with sudo access
_This chapiter is optional._

SSH is installed by defalut on the system by the installer. There is nothing to do to install it. If not:
```
sudo apt install ssh
```

SSH access is restricted to user who have a sudo access. They are not allowed to use simple username-password authentication, they have to have a couple of public-private keys configured to login.

To configure it we setup a rule int `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
Match Group sudo
 PasswordAuthentication no
Match all
```

Then, when a user have a couple of keys configued we can just add it to the sudo group with the command below.

`sudo usermod -a -G sudo USER`

# Customers isolation
Customer websites are isolated with the fact that we create homes with "others" rights to 0 and set umask of customers to 027 (see: client creation script).

# Script to create users

[A script](https://github.com/TGACPNV/CLD1-ConfigWebServer/blob/master/createclient.bash) named `createClient.bash` is available on the repository to create clients.

This script has to be ran as root (with the root account or sudo).
